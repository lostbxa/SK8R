SK8R is a TTRPG vaguely based on skater culture. 
# Themes
---
### Freedom
The freedom to choose exactly what makes you tick. The freedom to make your mark on the world as monumental or as personal as you want. The freedom to set your own goals and decide your own fate. No matter what you do, you'll have control over yourself and the impact you have on those around you. 

### Fluidity
Like the wind makes fallen leaves fly, and how rivers carve out their paths through mountains, you are not bound by the limitations of the average person. You can make your way through the densest of crowds, over titanic obstacles and around the most treacherous terrain without ever slowing down. 

### Fervour
Above all, everything you do, you do with passion in your heart. Whether you're on a critical mission or just on your way to meet your friends, you move with determination and focus that drives you further than most. 

Freedom, Fluidity, Fervour, these three pillars make up the lens through which we will experience the world of SK8R, and they should inform every decision you make as you play your way through your stories. 

# Systems

## [[F8]]
The events of your story will revolve around F8 (Fate) and the rolling mechanic behind it. Whenever a character in your story takes action that would result in an outcome that isn't immediately obvious you will do a [[F8 Check]] to determine the outcome.

## [[The World]]
Figuring out the world should be your group's first priority. Sometimes this task will be taken care of by your GM but other times you will all come together as a group to decide what kind of world you would like to play in. 
## [[Character Creation]]
Your character can be anyone you want it to be, your main goal with character creation is to come out the other side with a character that you will enjoy playing, and is interesting to you. 
Before creating your character you should consider what kind of character you would like to play. A no-nonsense pack leader, a goofy sprinter, or a mastermind navigator. 
Whether you play a character that embodies a well known archetype or an unconventional, never before seen combination of features, make sure whatever you build is something that you'll enjoy roleplaying, with abilities that you'll enjoy using. 
### [[Stamina & Moves]]
To take action within the story you must spend stamina. 

## [[Stats]]
Your attributes are represented with your stats

## [[Skillz]]
What you know how to do
