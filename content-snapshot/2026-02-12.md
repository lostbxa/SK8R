## Community
Part of what makes Air Gear (the primary inspiration for this) so special is the thorough integration of community into the story and setting. From the Emblems representing the organizational status of gangs, to the customization of Ikki's ATs using components from his friends. 

## Legacy
The existence of Roads and Regalia passed down to "Kings" of those roads imply a sense of depth and ancestry to the Storm Rider's lore in the world of Air Gear. Teams with rotating members and rich histories including rumors are emblematic of the involved lore of the world.
