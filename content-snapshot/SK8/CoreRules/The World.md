To make a world you'll have to decide on a few factors: 

## The Mood/Genre
Whether your world is lively and playful or serious and dangerous. Your world's mood and genre will determine the kind of character your player's will want to create to complement or contrast against in their adventures. 

| d6  | Genre   |     | Mood        |
| --- | ------- | --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Noir    |     | Grim        |
| 2   | Punk    |     | Whimsical   |
| 3   | Sci-Fi  |     | Eerie       |
| 4   | Fantasy |     | High-Octane |
| 5   | Action  |     | Intriguing  |
| 6   | Mystery |     | Dreamlike   |

## The Gimmick (Optional)
Once you've established your Mood/Genre you might want to establish a further Gimmick to give your world something else for your players to interact with.
